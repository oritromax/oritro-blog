I was working on a project, where I had to design a login panel. It had two columns, one for Login and one for registration. Now the problem was, when I made the initial commit to git, I forgot to insert an alert notification. I have to show some error when someone use wrong username password or missed a field in the registration form, or the username he is trying to get is already registered. That sort of stuff.

Now as I was using bootstrap, I can simply use the bootstrap alert. All I needed to do is insert the HTML code. But that I thought, why not a different approach? Especially I loved the alert UI of WordPress admin panel. So I figured, let&#8217;s shake some code ( not booty ).

I was about to write the whole thing here, but a friend suggested that I should circulate it to a broad network. And my first choice was Bootsnip. Probably the largest collection of bootstrap snippets. Helping me in my work for more than a year. <a href="http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/d0VDj" target="_blank">So i put it there</a>.
