After almost 15 years in the software industry, I’ve seen plenty of cycles of hype and fear, and today’s conversation around AI “taking all the programming jobs” is just the latest one.

> 👉 Let me be clear: don’t panic.

Yes, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot can generate code. But anyone who’s actually tried to build something non-trivial with them knows the truth: they don’t get it right on the first shot — or the second, or third.
 And more often than not, the code they generate is either:
- Too verbose
- Lacking critical architectural context
- Filled with surface-level correctness but deeply flawed assumptions
- Difficult to maintain without a deep understanding of what it's trying to do

In other words: AI suffers from the same core problem humans do — tons and tons of garbage code. But without the experience to recognize it.

The real work of a software engineer isn’t just “writing code.” It’s about:
- Understanding constraints and tradeoffs
- Navigating ambiguity
- Designing scalable systems
- Making decisions that affect people, performance, and long-term maintainability
- Communicating clearly with non-technical stakeholders
- Owning delivery and outcomes

🏋‍♀️ AI can assist in the mechanical parts of this process — boilerplate generation, refactoring suggestions, documentation — and that’s great! But it can’t own responsibility, context, or judgment.

The best engineers will adapt and use AI to enhance their productivity, not feel threatened by it.

🧾 In short: AI won't replace software engineers — but engineers who understand and effectively use AI might replace those who don't.

Stay curious. Stay valuable. Learn Programming, Don't Vibe Code.
