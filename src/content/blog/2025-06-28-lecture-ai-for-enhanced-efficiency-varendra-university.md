We focused on practical applications, including:
 - Automating mundane tasks to free up valuable time.
 - Enriching course materials with AI-powered details and resources to better support students.
 - Reducing administrative workload for teachers so they can dedicate more time to impactful activities like research and student mentorship.

This is a crucial step towards building a more efficient and effective educational environment. I look forward to seeing the positive changes that will come from this. 

Special thanks to Department of Political Science, Varendra University for inviting me to this workshop.
